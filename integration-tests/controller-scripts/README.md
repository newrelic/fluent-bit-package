# Controller scripts

The test suite located at [integration-tests/test-suite](integration-tests/test-suite) is meant to be run *on every
host* and has no environment/runtime awareness. This means that its report needs to be enriched with environment/runtime
information by the *controller*. This directory contains these scripts.

// TODO document roughly each script
