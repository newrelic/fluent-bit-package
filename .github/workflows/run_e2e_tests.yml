# So that only one test suite will be run simultaneously against a given GH release. This ensures that there will not
# be multiple runners accessing the same Terraform state at the same time. Note that we need to set this lock here as well
# as in the pull_request.yml since this workflow can also be run on-demand from the UI, and potentially by the infrastructure-agent
# CI/CD pipeline.
